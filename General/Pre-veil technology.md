## The Matrix (Puzzle)
- Found 247 years ago
- Testing was done, but naught was found
- The experiments noticed that when it was present, magic was more potent
	- Whatever it stores/does makes it interact with the chaos that is created with magic use, diminishing it, and thus amplifying the spell. 
- Some researchers though it was useful for getting to sleep
	- The evidence on this seems faulty (eepy researcher)

## The mask?

## The Infinite
- CRAP spends a lot of time on it
- Eventually gets it into a mobius loop, when in that state it says "Behold the infinite" 8 times
	- If you put something through the loop, it doesn't come out the otherside. 
	- Pyg exits the room, and does not return
	- We put some paper through the hole asking "Who are you"
		- It is returned saying Pyg
	- We exit the room and find ourselves in a hexagonal room with 6 doors, each with 1 more skull atop it than the last
	- Opening a door reveals that they have a black smoky void behind them
	- CRAP walks into the void and we never see him again
