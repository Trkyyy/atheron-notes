Origin
====
During your years hunting in the forests of Lumenwood you became intimately familiar with a phenomenon known is Chaos Touched Beasts. These creatures share many similarities with their uncorrupted kin but they are visibly distinct with cracked skin and glowing purple patterns across their body.

You have experienced that while these beasts may have lost their minds they have become more physically powerful. They are noticeably faster and from experience you know they can hit a lot harder.

How these beasts come to be has eluded you and many others but you know for sure they are dangerous to all life around them.
