====================
- We headed to the gutterworks market and asked around
   - The Gutter King:
      - He is the law, he keeps people safe
      - He stops thugs from roaming the streets, but at a cost
      - The halfing broth merchant is an idiot
      - Three people arrive and begin extorting, we kill two and capture the third
      - A stranger approaches (a fucking skeleton) - Pigmalion
- The prisoner tells us the sewers are where they are based
- We head there 
   - We do some stealthy work
   - We find a statue that has been defaced with a broken crown 
   - We find three people and kill them 
   - We fight some chaos beasts, and kill them
   - We find the gutter king and kill him, he has the following note on him:

"I see the enhancements have worked and allowed you to gain power quickly. Please continue to put preasure on the gutterworks.

L.N."
