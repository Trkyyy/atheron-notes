Client: Dockworkers’ Guild
 Location: South Wharf District, Berin’s Drydock
“Hands bled to the bone while the Consortium’s foreman lines his pockets!
 The men won’t stand for it, but the guard’s all bought and the merchants don’t care.
 We need a fair hand — someone with a lantern’s sense of balance — to see this sorted before the wharf turns to war.”
 — Lera Tosk, Dockworker Steward

Reward:
 100 gp

=========================
- We head to Berin's Drydock to investigate this request
- The strike is in full swing, none of the workstations are active
- We ask for directions to Lera Tosk and are told they are likely at the Bent Nail
- We head to the Bent Nail and find several people arguing about strategy
- They want us to find a bargaining chip
- They think speaking to the overseer, a Varun Ket, might be a start
- We go into Varun's office and begin speaking with them
   - He is indeed very slimy
   - He mentions hiring Wildkin
   - The staff have two options:
      1. They accept his demands
      2. They quit
   - He has payed out the guards
   - He tells us head office
   - We go to head office and break in
   - Grab some books from records office 
   - Find the office of a Jakabus Ket (Logistics overseer)
      - Letter saying Varun is a drain on resources from a Fester Sid
   - Find these peoples records
       - They constantly reference 'The Cartel'
   - We were told of a meeting between Varun and the golden sails during the night
   - We go to the warehouse and find a letter sating that Varun has completed closing the docks
